# AAU_Eco_BLDC_Inverter
Aalborg University BLDC control system for Shell EcoMarathon

This hardware achieved a second place in the efficiency competition Shell Ecomarathon Europe 2019 on a special designed hydrogen fueled eco racer car. The car was built by students at Aalborg University - Department of Energy Technology. We achieved a result of 214.27 km/m3 H2 (which is about 620 km/l 95 octane equivalent) and the motor system was a Grundfos PMSM motor and is rated at 2000 RPM, 2 Nm, 10.8V og 38A , but we are pushing it to 60A and 2500 RPM!

It's effectiveness with inverter included is best at 2000+ RPM and >1 Nm (90%), which put it at for our entire run (except for acceleration).

The initial work was done by the VESC Project. https://vesc-project.com/
